# CP1404 Practicals

## Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

Hello my name is Brent. This repository contains all of the work that was completed for the subject CP1404 at JCU.
3 Main Lessons I Have Learned About "clean code" in This Subject:

- Variables should all be named according to their type. The more specific the better.
- Following the PEP 8 convention is good practice.
- Don't use global variables.
